		<h1 id="about">Paranormal Investigations</h1>
		<p>As we humans evolved we expanded our knowledge of our world by seeking answers to our never ending 
		questioning. Are we alone, what happens when we die? But for every question answered 10 more take its place.
		One such question is if there is such a thing as a <em>spirit</em>. The paranormal world is unpredictable. 
		we know very little about it but know enough to know that there is something there. This concept has made 
		countless people devote their lives to finding the answer. In this page I will navigate you to a better
		understanding of what paranormal investigation is all about. </p>

		<p>Professional paranormal investigations are no longer a taboo aspiration in our society. There are numerous 
		television shows that follow locations where un explained occurrences have occurred. It is a fact that the 
		evidence to support <em>spirits</em> is overwhelming. Unfortunately scientist do not condone the existence of
	    such entities because the occurrences of such are unpredictable therefore un measurable. However, That doesn’t
	    stop people from investigating. I’m one of those people. But there are groups out there that are determined as
	     well as well funded. Here are a few. </p>

		<h2 class="equip-head"> Equipment Used </h2>
		<p class="equip">The equipment used in these types of investigation can vary from simple and inexpensive to exotic
		and costly. It mostly depends on you level of commitment. For the most parts, four items are used 
		regularly by paranormal investigators. These tech toys can be found either online or in the store.
		It is believed that <em>spirits</em> can sometimes interact with our physical world. Some scientist
		believes that <em>spirits</em>  is a form of human consciousness and continues to exist because
		of quantum mechanics. Whatever the reason, these devices work often when trying to contact them.

				 out of grave" width="400" height="300"/></a>
				<figcaption>This is the first apperition I caught on camera. It looks like it came out of the grave.

				 my camera. If you look closely you can see it's casting a shadow" width="200" height="400" />
				</a>
				<figcaption> This photograph is what I believe to be my holy grail of paranormal. At first I
				 thought this is a camera error, but then I took a closer look and discovered something 
				 incredible. If it was a camera fluke, or a bug flying close to the lens, it wouldn’t have
				 casted a shadow. Take a good look at it. The anomaly is actually casting a shadow on the ground.
				 And by the size of the shadow you can see clearly that it was away from the camera a good
				 two feet.

		<h3>Audio File</h3>
	
		<p>This is a very compelling piece of evidence captured by me. If you listen closely, you can hear the 
		<em>spirit</em> of a man whispering mama. I promise that this is not a prank or some sort of error. I
		was completely alone when I got this voice. And if analyzed on a professional audio program like Adobe
		Audition, you can clearly see that the frequency of the voce is not in that of the capability of human 
	 	hearing</p>
